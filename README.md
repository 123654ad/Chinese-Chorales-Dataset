# Chinese-Chorales-Dataset
For a long time, the chorales generation has been modeled on the JSB Chorales Dataset, which aims to generate Bach-style chorales. However, most of the current Chinese music datasets are unsuitable for the chorales generation task. This thesis introduces the Chinese Chorales Dataset, a high-quality Chinese chorales dataset containing 125 Chinese choral songs stored in MusicXML format and divided into 441 musical score segments. The dataset was produced by professional songwriters and is designed to meet the needs of Chinese composers to create high-quality choral songs. We also provide the .npz compressed file version containing pitch, fermata, beat, and chord information, which is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Meanwhile, we conducted several sets of experiments on this dataset to verify the validity of the information in this dataset.
